Challanges:

a. I have already some application running on the port 8080, hence I got to use some other port : 8089
   by editing the compose file.
b. Found error while executing the Chinook_PostgreSql.sql file, remove /c chinook, which is specific 
   to plsql

c. The Query(GraphiQL) which is specific to Hasura, it took time for me to understand.
    I also referred to the Udemy course which helped me to construct the GraphiQL queries
